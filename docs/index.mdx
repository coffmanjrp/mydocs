# Intro

I have launched my own personal reminder site. On this site, I will record what I have learned and experienced, so that I can refer to it later. The purpose of this site is to organize and efficiently manage the knowledge I have gained through my learning and life.

Through learning, I have discovered that writing out what I have understood by myself helps me to understand it more deeply. Also, when referring back to it later, I find that information that has been written out is easier to understand.

Through this site, I hope to be able to organize and efficiently manage the knowledge I have acquired. Also, I hope that this site will be useful to others as well.

Thank you for your support.
