# Installing iTerm2
iTerm2 can be installed on macOS by downloading the latest version from the [official website](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html) and opening the downloaded file. Once the file is opened, you should drag the iTerm2 icon to the Applications folder.

<br/>

Alternatively, you can install iTerm2 using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. To do this, you first need to install Homebrew by running the following command in the terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then, you can install iTerm2 by running this command:

```
brew install --cask iterm2
```

Once installed you can find the iTerm2 app in your application folder and open it.
