# Tmux session commands
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to divide a single terminal window into multiple panes and also to switch between multiple sessions. Here are some commonly used Tmux commands and their explanations:

| Command                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `control + g d`               | This command allows you to detach from the current Tmux session. This means that the session will continue running in the background while you work on other tasks in the terminal. To reattach the session later, you can use the tmux attach command.                                                                                                                                            |
| `tmux ls`                     | This command will list all the currently running Tmux sessions. It will display the session name and its status (attached or detached). This can be useful to check which sessions are currently active and to attach to a specific session later.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tmux -a -t <SESSION_NAME>`   | This command allows you to attach to a specific Tmux session by name. The `-a` flag tells Tmux to attach to the session even if it is already attached to another terminal, and the `-t <SESSION_NAME>` flag specifies the name of the session to attach to.                                                                                                                                       |
| `control + g s` => `0` or `1` | This command allows you to switch between different Tmux sessions. The number (`0` or `1`) following the Control + g s command specifies which session to switch to. For example, `Control + g s 0` will switch to session `0`, and `Control + g s 1` will switch to session `1`. This command is useful when you have multiple Tmux sessions running and you want to switch between them quickly. |
| `tmux kill-server`            | This command allows you to shut down the Tmux server. This will close all running sessions and exit Tmux. This command is useful when you want to close all running Tmux sessions and exit Tmux completely.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `control + g t`               | This command allows you to display the current time in the Tmux status bar. It is a useful command when you want to keep track of the time while working in Tmux.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
