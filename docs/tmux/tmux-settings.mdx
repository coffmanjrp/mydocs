# Customizing Tmux settings
Take control of your Tmux experience by customizing the settings file.
### Change the prefix key
By default, the prefix key for Tmux is "b". However, you can change it to a different key by following these steps:
1. Create a file called "`.tmux.conf`" in your home directory.
2. Open the file with a text editor.
3. Set the following settings in the file:
```
unbind C-d
set -g prefix C-g
bind C-g send-prefix
```
This will change the prefix key to "g" instead of the default "b".
### Customize divide pane keys
To set the divide pane key-bind, you can add the following settings in the `.tmux.conf` file:
```
bind \\ split-window -h
bind - split-window -v
```
This will allow you to use "\" to split panes horizontally and "-" to split panes vertically, respectively.
### Change the display time of pane numbers 
To adjust the display time of pane numbers, add the following line to the file:
```
set -g display-panes-time 3000
```
This will make the pane numbers visible for 3 seconds.
### Escape from Vim mode more quickly
To set the faster escape time in Vim mode, add the following line to the file:
```
set -s escape-time 0
```
### Switch windows with shift + arrow
To switch between windows using shift + arrow keys, add the following lines to the file:
```
bind -n S-Left previous-window
bind -n S-Right next-window
```
Make sure to save the changes and restart Tmux for the new settings to take effect.
