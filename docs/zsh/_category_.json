    "description": "zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell), similar to the Bourne Shell (sh) but includes many enhancements. Some of the key features of zsh include command line editing, built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion, and more. It is often considered more powerful and user-friendly than the default shell on many Linux and macOS systems, the Bourne Again Shell (bash)."
